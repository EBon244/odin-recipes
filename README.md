# odin-recipes

The current project is to build a website using the fundamentals of HTML. I will be using my knowledge to create a website which contains information of a recipe and links to its source.

Reflection (When Complete)
Overall a fairly basic project that was more time consuming than hard. Although it helped shed light on improvements I need to make
like memorization of certain commands. I look forward to coming back and seeing how poorly my website was made!
